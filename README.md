# ST Iconic toolbar win10

Have idea to provide users toolbar such as “submenu” with most common commands shaped like an icons (buttons). Work on OS-W10 so will check performance in it, however might be possible to adopt for other OS later?

At this moment icons work well, but a few issues would be greatfull to perform:
1.	Nice to get a tooltip like “Save file” when hover mouse above the button. "SOS" or "Help" wellcome ;
2.	Nice to insert this toolbar in second row like submenu, #preview2 which possible to set this toolbar either “visible” or not independent from main toolbar. The last button “toggle toolbar” presently hide all the menu together with this. The idea is to use two menus, only how to realize – no idea in this moment;
3.	Like a best option the icon’s will be much better viewed if render from url’s like small png, svg images. Font symbols now looks like from XX century. However, even adding colors to symbols will improve. Can you help (advise)?
4.	Generally I’m very interested Sublime and gonna learn about it’s architecture, built-in system and Core. Please direct me where to start from, for understanding a bit dipper that use of package control.
